# known-smallheader

This plugin replaces the (imho strange looking) white header of a Known (withknown.com) site when you are not
logged in. Instead it shows just two icons; one to go back to the main site and one to login. If you are
logged in however, everything stays as it was and the usual header is shown.

## Usage

Clone this repository, rename the directory to _SmallHeader_ and put it inside your _IdnoPlugins_ directory.
Afterwards activate the plugin in the administration interface. Woosh - the header is gone (at least when
you are not logged in).
